MAJOR:
 curses gui
  currently-playing <- artist <- track <- at@sec/min <- total@sec/min <- playing-bar?
 daemon-mode for kilo
 stop using spotify's alsa-audio.h/c

MEDIUM:
 searching for tracks/artists
 last.fm scrobble

MINOR:


BUGS:
 End-of-track is way too slow, noticable gap between tracks
 pause is not instant - takes a second or so. (play is instant though)
 src/alsa_audio.h:47:10: warning: ISO C forbids zero-size array ‘samples’

DONE:
 Removed all "Relogin" and "Blob instead of password" entries in the code
 Fixed the application arguments
  Application now gives some usage help and exits on wrong arguments
  Fixed minor bug with optargs
 Application now automatically asks for the highest possible bitrate
  Not sure if there'll ever be a reason to NOT have the highest? 
 Added force-update command which is only available in debug-mode, which \
  forces an update on the euterpe-loop
