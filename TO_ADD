MAJOR:
 curses gui
  currently-playing <- artist <- track <- at@sec/min <- total@sec/min <- playing-bar?
 last.fm scrobble
 daemon-mode for kilo
 searching for tracks/artists
 stop using spotify's alsa-audio.h/c

MINOR:
 bitrate?

 pause is not instant - takes a second or so. (play is instant though)
 src/alsa_audio.h:47:10: warning: ISO C forbids zero-size array ‘samples’
