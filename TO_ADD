MAJOR:
 curses gui
  currently-playing <- artist <- track <- at@sec/min <- total@sec/min <- playing-bar?
 last.fm scrobble
 daemon-mode for kilo
 searching for tracks/artists
 stop using spotify's alsa-audio.h/c

MINOR:
 bitrate? 

BUGS:
 End-of-track is way too slow, noticable gap between tracks
 pause is not instant - takes a second or so. (play is instant though)
 src/alsa_audio.h:47:10: warning: ISO C forbids zero-size array ‘samples’

DONE:
 Added some documentation
 renamed euterpe_play_list to euterpe_set_playlist, which no longer auto-stats music
 renamed euterpe_change_track to euterpe_play_track
 added euterpe_play_pause_toggle which pauses/plays songs
 minor bugfixes
